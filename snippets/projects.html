        <h2 class="space--after-half">TLDR</h2>
        <p class="space--after-double">You’re going to pick a theme to explore visually for the duration of the semester. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry to a collection that explores this theme. At the end of the semester, you’ll deliver a website that houses 10 programmed entries. The website container is part of the design, as well.</p>

        <h2 class="space--after-half">Project Description</h2>
        <p class="space--after-single">In mathematics, a sequence is defined as a series of numbers arranged in a predictable pattern. It’s a type of number set which follows specific, definite rules. When translated to design, sequencing is a natural part of systems—each individual item has unifying elements that when looked at as a whole, tells a larger story.</p>
        <p class="space--after-single">In this class you’ll create a Harmonic Collection that explores a theme of your choice. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry into your collection that makes use of the design focus and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills we’re developing.</p>
        <p class="space--after-single">First, you will pick a theme of your choice (think of it as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches). Your theme should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. (Example themes: Your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week).</p>
        <p class="space--after-double">In the final weeks of the semester, you’ll refine your 10 entries so that they communicate a clear exploration and deliver a website that houses all of them together. You might need to re-organize or add additional content to your container or entries to fully realize your idea.</p>

        <h2 class="space--after-half">Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <ol class="space--after-double">
            <li class="space--after-single">The website and all the entries must be responsive (work on a variety of screen sizes).</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">While each entry will be unique, there should be unifying visual components between them.</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">All hyperlinks must be functional.</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">Each week’s entry will make use of that week’s design focus.</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">You will use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to communicate a story.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="space--after-half">Midterm Edit</h2>
        <p class="space--after-single">For Midterms, we will have a one-on-one meeting. At that time, you will present a refined iteration of your current collection. Prior to this meeting, you’ll chat with your fellow classmates about the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="space--after-single">What is your theme? Has it evolved from the initial description?</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">How is the content communicating the theme? What about the design?</li>
            <li class="space--after-single">How would you describe the pacing of the collection so far? Does it feel considered? Can there be a moment for a dramatic break, or an acceleration?</li>
            <li class="space--after-double">Are there opportunities to establish a template or system to the design—if so, when, where, and how? Can we break the system mindfully to add interest?</li>
        </ol>
