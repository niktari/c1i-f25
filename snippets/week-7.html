                <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback from your classmates, refine your Harmonic Collection as much as you can. Be prepared to present your collection to me next week during our one-on-one. During our meeting, we will discuss how your collection is shaping up, review your code, and answer any technical, design, and/or conceptual questions you have.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Additionally, write a paragraph that explains your collection’s theme so far, along with three avenues you can explore to push your collection for the remaining weeks of the semester. For instance, do you have an idea for how you’d like to rethink the overall pacing of your collection? Do you want to make the design more cohesive across all entries? Or completely different? How do these routes you plan to take relate to the theme of your collection?</p>

                <p class="display--inline-block">Extra Credit: Flexbox Letterforms</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Explore the use of Flexbox to create gridded letterforms. You can choose a word, create an alphabet, or go crazy on one letter. If you want to lean into pixelation, great. If you want to create more organic letterforms, consider what other CSS properties you can use to break up the rigidity of the grid. Maybe border-radius? Softer colors? Shapes that are not just squares and circles? Play around!</p>
