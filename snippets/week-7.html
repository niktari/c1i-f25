                <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback from your classmates, refine your Harmonic Collection as much as you can. Be prepared to present your collection to me next week during our one-on-one. During our meeting, we will discuss how your collection is shaping up, review your code, and answer any technical, design, and/or conceptual questions you have.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Additionally, write a paragraph that explains your collection’s theme so far, along with three avenues you can explore to push your collection for the remaining weeks of the semester. For instance, do you have an idea for how you’d like to rethink the overall pacing of your collection? Do you want to make the design more cohesive across all entries? Or completely different? How do these routes you plan to take relate to the theme of your collection?</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">In the class Notion, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Harmonic-Collection-Midterm-Edit-11755da29c23800d8cb5fee3cbab9aa3" class="link--underline">claim a page here</a> by adding your name to the title, and write your explanation in the document.</p>
