Make sure your name is in your file. Consider typography and layout: how can you break the top-to-bottom, left-to-right default layout of the page?</li>
                    <li>Go to code. Create an <code class="red">index.html</code> file and <code class="red">style.css</code> file in your <code class="red">entry-5</code> folder. Translate your design in Figma to a live website using HTML and CSS. For this week, see if you can make your website responsive. Can you work with relative units? Can you make your entry look good on mobile? Additionally, think about responsiveness as a creative opportunity: do you want someone to have a similar or completely different experience based on their device? Depending on which route you take, how does it relate to your overall theme?</li>
