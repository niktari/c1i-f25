                <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback from your classmates, push your Harmonic Collection during these last two weeks. If you would like, schedule time with me via my <a href="https://calendly.com/niktari/30min" class="link--underline">Calendly</a> during the week of 12/1 so we can discuss the progress of your collection. This is optional but highly encouraged.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">In addition to the visual and technical updates to your project, write a paragraph that clearly articulates your collection’s theme as it stands now. Reflect on how your collection has evolved since the midterm edit — what changes did you make, and did anything shift significantly in concept, form, or direction? Then, propose one focused plan for how you will develop the final version over the next two weeks. This might involve rethinking the pacing or flow, refining the visual language for stronger cohesion (or intentional contrast), expanding interactivity, or implementing a new design strategy. Explain how this plan reinforces your core theme and why it feels like the right path forward.</p>
