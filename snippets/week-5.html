Translate your design in Figma to a live website using HTML and CSS. Consider how you can break the top-to-bottom, left-to-right default flow of the webpage by utilizing the <code class="red">position</code> property. Additionally, based on what you've learned about nested hovering and targeting, consider how you can make your entry interactive.
