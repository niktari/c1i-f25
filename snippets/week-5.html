                <p class="space--after-single">For class this past week, you attended the CD Lecture Series where designer and artist Bráulio Amado gave a talk. In the class Notion, <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.notion.so/CD-Lecture-Series-Reflection-10955da29c23809c9dabd7f2dd4f68a1">claim a page here</a> by adding your name to the title, and write a 250-word minimum reflection on the talk. Was there anything insightful or inspiring that you took away from his talk? Was there a piece of work that he presented that stuck out to you? Is there anything from his process or practice that you’d like to incorporate into your explorations within this class or beyond?</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">No need to submit a link in the Notion Submission Matrix. Just make sure that you’ve claimed a page with your name and written your reflection by next class.</p>

                <p class="space--after-single">Continue practicing CSS typography and layout by styling up your homepage. Design your homepage in a way that relates to your theme. Consider how you’d like to organize your entries so it’s not just in an ordered list. How else can someone visiting your collection navigate to each entry? And how does that navigation relate to the theme of your collection?</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Think about what default styles you’d like to override, and if you’re keeping them, be intentional about it. For instance, are you keeping the hyperlinks blue because it makes sense for your collection to look a bit brutalist?</p>
