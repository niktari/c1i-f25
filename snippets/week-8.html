                <p class="display--inline-block">Harmonic Collection: Refinement</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback from our 1:1 midterm meeting, take this week to really refine and push your Harmonic Collection. Treat it as a standalone website, independent of the class. For instance, if you were to share your website with someone outside of this class, would they understand its purpose or concept? If not, then what design or content decisions do you need to make in order to add more clarity to your collection? A simple start could be breaking away from the "Entry X" page titles and instead renaming them to something that aligns with your theme. Consider your homepage: how can it serve as a more thoughtful and thematic container for all of your entries?</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Additionally, explore how you can make your collection responsive. For example, revisit your entries and assess where you can utilize relative units or media queries to create an optimal experience for other devices. I suggest reviewing the lecture slides on <a href="https://www.figma.com/deck/62zn9g6AIoGvuLPM2gsJ4X/Week-6--Responsive-Design?node-id=1-131&viewport=-105%2C-49%2C0.5&t=P3Lfyc6xXa1HHXeM-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1" class="link--underline">Responsive Design</a> while you work through this.</p>
