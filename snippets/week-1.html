                <p class="display--inline-block">Harmonic Collection: 3 Ideas</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Bring three thematic ideas for your Harmonic Collection projects and be prepared to discuss them in class. Think of these potential themes as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Your themes should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. Some example themes include but are not limited to: your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week. We’ll be starting on this project next week.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Create a three-minute presentation of your 3 ideas using the Slides feature in Figma. Each slide should be 1920 x 1080 pixels wide. At the bare minimum, your presentation should include the following for each idea:</p> 
                <ol class="space--after-single">
                    <li>A slide that explains your idea generally and visually.</li>
                    <li>A slide that explains why you’re interested in the idea.</li>
                    <li>Two to three slides that highlight some visual examples of sketches, inspiration, ideas, or other websites you like.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="space--after-single">You are welcome to work off <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.figma.com/slides/G2BKTkq038ZjxGleke576v/-TEMPLATE--Three-Ideas?node-id=1-42&t=udEkGteXvvU34qq4-1">this template</a>, but be sure to duplicate the file and make it your own. Your slides should also be designed thoughtfully.
