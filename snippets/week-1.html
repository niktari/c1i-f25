                <p class="display--inline-block">Harmonic Collection: 3 Ideas</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Bring three thematic ideas for your Harmonic Collection projects and be prepared to discuss them in class. Think of these potential themes as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Your themes should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. Some example themes include but are not limited to: your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week. We’ll be starting on this project next week.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Create a three-minute presentation of your 3 ideas using Figma. Each slide (or “frame”) should be 1920 x 1080 pixels wide. Include a description of each idea, along with any images that’ll help support your thoughts. You are welcome to work off <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.figma.com/design/679jrd7azXw5U1nCSVW6jx/%5BTemplate%5D-Harmonic-Collection-%E2%80%93-Three-Ideas?node-id=1-2&t=5VrNIRQNIsSLWppt-1">this template</a>, but be sure to duplicate the file and make it your own. After you’ve created a Figma account and <a class="link--underline" href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041061214-Verify-education-status">verified your education status</a>, <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/O4JwDRlikh1sSYaeN9Os2d">join our class team here</a>. Your file should be in the <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.figma.com/files/project/269601667/%5BHarmonic-Collection%5D-3-Ideas?fuid=834826180679236035">“[Harmonic Collection] 3 Ideas”</a> folder.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Figma has plenty of helpful tutorials on YouTube. I recommend you watch some of the videos in their <a class="link--underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4">"Figma for beginners"</a> playlist.</p>
